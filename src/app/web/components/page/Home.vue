    p This is my attempt to make classic quake accessible.  
      | This runs the quake engine in your browser. Tanks to Triang3l 
      | for the line to line conversion of the original C source to Javascript.
      | My goal is to make the classic quake easily accessbile to anyone without
      | having to worry about command lines or engine executables
      
    p I've continued his development and made the engine modular in order to easily embed into
      | modern web frontends like this one.

    p This is a pet project of mine of which I've wanted to ever since I first saw Triang3l's work,
      | and will plan on adding new features for my own amusement.

    p -Joe
