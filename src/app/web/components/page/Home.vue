    p This is my attempt to make classic quake accessible.  
      | This runs the quake engine in your browser. Thanks to Triang3l 
      | for the line to line conversion of the original C source to Javascript.
      | My goal is to make the classic quake easily accessible to anyone without
      | having to worry about command lines or engine executables
